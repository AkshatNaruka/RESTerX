## üöÄ Installation

To install RESTerX, you need to have Go installed on your machine. Once you have Go installed, you can clone this repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkshatNaruka/RESTerX
cd RESTerX
go build -o restcli ./cmd
```

This will create an executable file in your project directory.

## üìñ Usage

### Web Interface (Recommended)

Start the web server:
```bash
./restcli web
```

Or specify a custom port:
```bash
./restcli web --port 3000
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or your custom port).

#### Web Interface Features:
1. **Select HTTP Method**: Choose from GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD
2. **Enter URL**: Type your API endpoint
3. **Add Headers**: Use the Headers tab to add custom headers
4. **Set Request Body**: Use the Body tab for JSON, form data, or raw text
5. **Configure Auth**: Use the Auth tab for Bearer token or Basic authentication
6. **Send Request**: Click Send to make the request
7. **View Response**: See status code, response time, body, and headers
8. **History**: Access previous requests from the sidebar

### CLI Interface

For command-line usage:
```bash
./restcli
```

This will start an interactive menu where you can select the HTTP method you want to use. After selecting a method, you will be prompted to enter the URL for the request.

## üîß Development

To contribute to RESTerX:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## üöÄ Static Site Deployment

RESTerX includes automatic deployment of the web interface as a static site to GitHub Pages. The deployment workflow is triggered automatically on pushes to the main branch.

### How it works:
- The GitHub Actions workflow copies the static files from `web/static/` directory
- Deploys them to GitHub Pages for easy access without running a local server
- The static site provides basic HTTP request testing functionality for external APIs

### Limitations of Static Deployment:
- Mock server features require the backend API
- Code generation features require the backend API  
- History and collections are stored locally in browser storage
- All other HTTP testing features work normally

### Accessing the Static Site:
Once deployed, the static site will be available at: `https://{username}.github.io/{repository-name}/`

## üìù API Endpoints

The web interface uses the following API endpoints:

- `POST /api/request` - Send HTTP requests
  - Request body: `{"method": "GET", "url": "...", "headers": {...}, "body": "..."}`
  - Response: `{"statusCode": 200, "status": "OK", "headers": {...}, "body": "...", "responseTime": 123}`
